# Nuclear-Physics-System

Inspired by: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4aI-MBTl5w

By Utilizing Rutherford's Atomic Model, I was able to create nuclear
physics in the roblox game engine. 

More specifically, I applied the Coulomb's law version of the electric
force and Yukawa potentials for the nuclear force calculation.
